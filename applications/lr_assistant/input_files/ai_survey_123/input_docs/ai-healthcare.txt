promises.
A selection of AI applications offers
insights into specific tasks for which
generative AI can be effectively utilised. These
applications can truly make a difference by
saving time, streamlining workflows, and
potentially enhancing the quality of the
resulting outputs.
Introduction
n n an era of rapid technological pro -
gression, artificial intelligence (AI)
language models have emerged as transformative
forces, significantly altering traditional workflows
and methodologies across many fields, including
medical writing.
As medical writers preparing for an
AI-dominated future, we need to understand how
these AI language models work. It will allow us
to truly leverage their potential, comprehend
their capabilities and limitations, and integrate
them effectively into our writing processes.
Many of us tend to view the quantity of
training data and parameters as crucial deter -
minants of a model’s performance. Indeed, we get
all hyped up when respective players announce
that the next-generation AI language model will
be trained on x amount more data
or are tailored towards a more
specific subject, additionally
claiming enhanced speed, relia -
bility, and accuracy. Yet, are these
factors truly game-changing?
Maybe not exclusively. The
intrinsic nature of the model, the
underlying algorithms, and their
data processing method ologies
hold equal significance.
Therefore, let’s aim to grasp
the mechanics of AI language
models before delving into their
practical applications.
Understand AI language models and
their limitations
Behind the scenes – Terminology
A large language model (LLM) is a deep
learning technique, and a subset of machine
learning, that uses artificial neural networks to
analyse immense volumes of data, unveil intricate
patterns, and guide decision-making. Through
extensive training on massive datasets, LLMs
develop an unparalleled capacity to recognise,
comprehend, predict, and generate novel content
spanning myriad domains
(Figure 1).
The term generative AI
(genAI) refers to all AI tools that
use LLMs to primarily create
content such as images (e.g.,
Midjourney or Stable Diffusion),
text (e.g., GPT-4, PaLM, or
Claude), code (e.g., Copilot), or
audio (e.g., VALL-E or
resemble.ai) in response to short
prompts. To process a prompt,
its words need to be converted
into a model-readable input
format, such as vectors or tokens.
Tokens can be as small as
individual characters or punctu ation symbols, or
as large as words or even whole sentences,
depending on the model and tokenisation
method (e.g., rule-based, statistical, neural). This
process of breaking down text into individual
units is called tokenisation (Figure 2).

Tokens are processed by assigning each token
a numerical ID as AI models can only process
numerical data.
Modern LLMs and hence genAI tools
successfully apply transformer architecture
(Figure 3). Two key features define transformers:
the encoder-decoder structure and the attention
mechanism. The encoder processes the input data
and generates a set of context vectors. Using these
vectors, the decoder generates the output by
selecting the token with the highest probability
in a sequence of tokens. The
attention mechanism, a crucial
element in transformers, assigns a
weight to an input token, guiding
the model on where to focus
during output generation. This
process enables the model to
manage long-range data depen -
dencies, effectively equipping the
model with long-term memory
(Figure 3).
When a prompt is submitted
to an AI language model, it
generates the response by
selecting the most likely next
token based on calculated
context and specific rules/
settings. That means tokens/
words are chosen based on their
likelihood to follow.
In simple terms, these models
are mathematical functions sup -
ported by powerful computing
capabilities, but they cannot
think. This is an important factor to consider
when assessing the results produced by these AI
tools, setting your expectations, and highlighting
their limitations.
Sophisticated prompt engineering, which
involves giving specific and detailed instructions
to guide the model in its decision-making or
prediction process, can enhance a model’s
performance. Depending on the task, methods
such as few-shot prompting, which provides a
few input-output examples, chain of thought

prompting (CoT), which uses sequential prompts to encourage reasoning or guide the model through complex tasks, and prompt iteration, have been found to be most successful in elevating a model’s performance.
To avoid confusion, the term LLM/AI language model is used in conjunction with a range of natural language processing tasks, including text generation, translation, content summary, rewriting content, classification and categorisation, sentiment analysis, and conversational AI and chatbots.
OpenAI’s GPT-series (the GPT stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is widely recognised as one of the most extensively utilised LLMs at present. ChatGPT, along with its respective plugins, stands out as a prominent representative within this series.
In the following sections, we will focus on text-generating AI tools and use terminology such as LLM, AI language model, AI assistant interchangeably.
Limitations of AI language models
Despite being trained on increasingly larger datasets, using more parameters and unprece dented computational power, current genAI models are primarily sophisticated “prediction engines”. While their performance consistently improves, it is important to remember that their output lacks true comprehension, critical thinking, or consciousness. Consequently, the generated texts have a tendency to be lengthy and articulate replies that could potentially include plausible but inaccurate or biased information. Therefore, it is mandatory that users review the output critically and always check its accuracy, appropriateness, context, and actual usefulness before accepting any result.
Especially in medical writing, text-generating AI tools should be regarded as assistants or a tool in the toolbox supporting workflows, providing a starting base, or helping to overcome writer’s block. The human ability to comprehend con text, strategise, critically evaluate, and convey nuanced emotions remains irreplaceable.
It is also essential to address privacy concerns when using text-generation tools. Careful consid eration should be given to the inclusion of safe input data to prevent the inadvertent sharing of confidential or proprietary information.
The potential disruptiveness of this technology is not going unrecognised. Many journals and organisations have published guidelines with the intent to regulate the use of text-generation tools for publications (Springer-Nature,1 Elsevier,2 Taylor & Francis,3 JAMA Network,4 the World Association of Medical Editors [and British Medical Journal],5 and the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors6).
With a grasp of these basics, you’re well-prepared to begin or continue your journey with AI language models. Embracing an open mind and adopting a trial-and-error approach will facilitate exploration, learning, and the develop ment of an AI-driven mindset. Establishing a clear understanding of these models will enable their effective use in workflow areas where they truly excel. This knowledge also helps to maintain a realistic perspective, preventing undue fear or over-enthusiasm sparked by the current AI hype and its associated promises and expectations.
AI tools that can assist medical writers
Besides ChatGPT and its respective plugins, hundreds of AI-assisted, text-generating tools are launched weekly or integrated into existing applications as AI assistants. Keeping track of these numerous tools can be daunting for a busy professional. Therefore, below is presented a curated selection of widely accepted tools which could prove valuable to the majority of medical writers (see also Figure 4).
AI language models are transforming the medical writing space | Martin
Can genAI assist medical writing?
Yes it can.
GenAI, and ChatGPT in particular, can be used to assist with many tasks, including:
lParaphrasing
lReformatting references to different styles
lRewriting materials and methods sections
lExplaining statistical tests
lRewriting abstracts
lExtracting article highlights
lSuggesting keywords
lWriting submission letters
lSummarising scientific articles or medical information for various audiences
lWriting lay summaries
lRepurposing available information for different formats and various audiences
lCreating educational and other training materials such as courses, webinars, presentations, hand-outs
lCompiling product and safety information
lGenerating responses to customer inquiries
lGenerating scripts for chatbots/virtual assistants and much more.
Embracing an open mind and adopting a trial-and-error approach will facilitate exploration, learning, and the development of an AI-driven mindset.
Text-generating AI applications are sophisticated prediction engines; they predict words or tokens based on their likelihood to follow.
Think of them as “word calculators” that use mathematic functions and mechanisms to fill in the gaps/blanks in a data set with the intental ways to provide an answer.
Their performance depends not only on the quantity and quality of their training data or parameters, but also on factors such as model characteristics (transformer architecture, fine-tuning, combination of models), tokenisation method, and human skills (e.g., prompt engineering).

Writing and rewriting assistants
Let’s start with Quillbot and Wordtune, two AI-rewriting
assistants. Quillbot is a comprehensive paraphrasing tool
targeted at improving grammar and enhancing wording;
it also features a summariser tool. Its smaller alternative,
Wordtune, helps you rephrase, improves tone and word
choice, and is able to shorten or expand given text.
Conversation
Another extremely useful application and time-saver is
ChatPDF. It allows you to chat with uploaded pdfs, such
as scientific articles. It can answer specific questions and,
when prompted correctly, returns structured responses.
Research plus writing assistance
scite_ is a platform that helps discover and evaluate
scientific articles via Smart Citations. Smart Citations
allows users to see how a publication has been cited by
providing the context of the citation and a classification
describing whether it provides supporting or contrasting
evidence for the cited claim. Importantly, scite_ offers an
integrated conversational AI Assistant, based on GPT-3.5.
It can answer questions from a database of 180 million
articles, book chapters, and data sets. Just like ChatGPT,
it can assist you in the writing process for a plethora of
materials.
SciSpace, an AI research assistant, is not only able to
read, understand, and explain uploaded scientific
literature, but it also comprises a citation generator,
paraphraser, and AI detector.
SciSpace Copilot, available as Chrome Extension, can
help understand technical language, math, and tables in
PDFs, and allows you to organise and annotate materials
to keep track of important information. This one is to
watch!
Another free AI research assistant is Elicit. It assesses
publications from Semantic Scholar and helps expedite the
literature review process. When queried, it retrieves
relevant papers and summarises key information in table
format.
In addition, the AI tools ResearchRabbit and
Connected Papers are definitely worth checking out. For
these tools, the user provides specific citations (seeding)
and the models search and visually map similar work. This
greatly speeds up and deepens the discovery phase, no
matter what research phase you are in.
Summary plus writing assistance
Scholarcy is an online article summariser tool for articles,
reports, and book chapters. It highlights key sections for
users to easily save and export summaries to return to at a
later date.
26 | September 2023 Medical Writing | Volume 32 Number 3
AI language models are transforming the medical writing space | Martin
Unlike Elicit, it can only summarise one
publication at a time but in much more detail.
It extracts key concepts, a synopsis of the fulltext,
comparative analysis, and more.
An alternative AI-assisted research and
summary tool is genei. It is designed to help users
improve productivity by quickly extracting key
information from articles, analyzing research, and
summarizing articles. The paid subscription has
the usual GPT-3 capabilities.
Generative AI tools excel in marketing
support
GenAI tools have long been embraced in content
marketing, where they outperform classical
copywriters. From blogs, and website content, to
social media posts, email marketing campaigns,
newsletters, ads, and much more – genAI is
widely adopted.
I recommend trying out Jasper.ai, a powerful
all-in-one content generation platform trained to
write original, creative content for all sorts of
marketing assets. It also builds on OpenAI but
adds other models to provide tailored solutions
to specific content marketing needs. A big plus is
that it comes with templates that help you
structure and detail your prompts
and a plagiarism checker.
Copy.Ai is a valid alternative
to Jasper. Another tool, AIwriter,
searches, writes content,
and adds valid references to this
content.
Every week, more than 100
new AI tools are released, and it is up to us, the
users, to stay informed and check their feasi bility
to enhance our workflows. Only the most
valuable appli cations will get adopted and
survive. It is impossible to predict what the next
developments and releases will be and how the
tools will integrate and complement each other.
Exciting times are ahead!
Future-proof yourself and let AI
amaze you!
AI language models and applications are set to
reshape the medical writing space, redefining
traditional workflows and methodologies in the
process. Navigating this shift
requires an open attitude,
curiosity, and a commitment to
continuous learning. Consider
genAI applications as tools in
your arsenal. Merely possessing a
toolbox isn’t enough; you need to
know which tool to use for which
task and how to use it effectively.
Our unique human abilities – understanding
context, strategic thinking, critical evaluation,
and conveying nuanced emotions – remain
invaluable. They set us apart and play a crucial
role in moderating and refining AI-generated
output. Harness the potential of these AI tools to
boost your productivity and elevate the quality
