      "<p>Background  Baricitinib, an oral selective Janus kinase (JAK)1/JAK2 inhibitor, is approved in many countries for moderate-to-severe atopic | dermatitis (AD) in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.| Objectives  To evaluate the efficacy and safety of three doses of baricitinib in combination with low-to-moderate potency topical corticoste-| roids in paediatric patients with moderate-to-severe AD.| Methods  Patients (aged 2 to  <  18 years) were randomized (1 : 1 : 1 : 1) to once-daily baricitinib low dose (1 mg equivalent), medium dose | (2 mg equivalent), high dose (4 mg equivalent) or placebo for 16 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving a vali-| dated Investigator Global Assessment\n",
      "<s10>®\n",
      "<p> (vIGA-AD) of 0/1 with a  ≥  2-point improvement at week 16. Key secondary endpoints included the pro-| portions of patients achieving  ≥  75% and  ≥  90% improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75 and EASI-90, respectively), | ≥  75% improvement in the SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD 75), mean change from baseline in EASI score and proportion of patients | achieving a 4-point improvement in the Itch Numeric Rating scale (NRS) for patients aged  ≥  10 years. Primary and key secondary efficacy | analyses were conducted on the intent-to-treat population and adjusted for multiplicity. Safety analyses included all randomized patients who | received  ≥  1 dose of study treatment.|\n",
      "<p>Results  A total of 483 patients were randomized (mean age 12 years). The baricitinib 4 mg equivalent achieved a statistically significant | ( P <  0.05) improvement vs. placebo on all 16-week endpoints (vIGA 0/1 with  ≥  2-point improvement, EASI-75, EASI-90, SCORAD 75, mean | change in EASI score and Itch NRS 4-point improvement for patients aged  ≥  10 years). Improvement ( P <  0.05, non-multiplicity adjusted) was | also observed for baricitinib 4 mg equivalent vs. placebo in the ability to fall asleep and in reduction of topical corticosteroid use. Few patients | discontinued due to adverse events (1.6% for placebo and 0.6% for those treated with baricitinib). There were no deaths, venous thrombo-| embolic events, arterial thrombotic events, major adverse cardiovascular events, malignancies, gastrointestinal perforations or opportunistic | infections seen.| Conclusions  The results indicate that baricitinib offers a potential therapeutic option with a favourable benefit–risk profile for paediatric pa-| tients with moderate-to-severe AD who are candidates for systemic therapies.|\n",

The current study | results showed a reduction in the use of TCS by patients | receiving the baricitinib 4 mg equivalent dose; however, the | use of more TCS in the placebo arm over time allowed the | placebo arm to improve in efficacy albeit more slowly than | the active treatment arms. The greater use of background | TCS in the placebo group and reduction in TCS use for the | 4 mg equivalent dose group in this study potentially led to | the observation of early improvement (nominal  P <  0.05) | for the baricitinib 4 mg equivalent vs. placebo on some | secondary outcomes, including the POEM and CDLQI, | which diminished at later timepoints as the placebo group | continued to improve. Positive efficacy was found in this | 16-week trial; however, this timeframe and extent of expo-| sure limits the assessment of long-term outcomes. The | BREEZE-AD PEDS study includes a long-term extension | in which patients will continue to be monitored for up to | four additional years, allowing further characterization of the | benefit–risk profile of baricitinib in paediatric patients with | moderate-to-severe AD.|\n",

The observed safety profile | was consistent with that established for baricitinib treat-| ment of adults with moderate-to-severe AD and no new | safety signals were observed.
