       "\"Published: 2024-03-18\\nTitle: EnvGen: Generating and Adapting Environments via LLMs for Training Embodied Agents\\nAuthors: Abhay Zala, Jaemin Cho, Han Lin, Jaehong Yoon, Mohit Bansal\\nSummary: Recent SOTA approaches for embodied learning via interaction directly employ\\nlarge language models (LLMs) as agents to determine the next steps in an\\nenvironment. Due to their world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, LLM\\nagents achieve stronger performance than previous smaller agents based on\\nreinforcement learning (RL); however, frequently calling LLMs is slow and\\nexpensive. Instead of directly employing LLMs as agents, can we use LLMs'\\nreasoning capabilities to adaptively create training environments to help\\nsmaller embodied RL agents learn useful skills that they are weak at? We\\npropose EnvGen, a novel framework to address this question. First, we prompt an\\nLLM to generate training environments that allow agents to quickly learn\\ndifferent tasks in parallel. Concretely, the LLM is given the task description\\nand simulator objectives that the agents should learn and is then asked to\\ngenerate a set of environment configurations (e.g., different terrains, items\\ngiven to agents, etc.). Next, we train a small RL agent in a mixture of the\\noriginal and LLM-generated environments. Then, we enable the LLM to\\ncontinuously adapt the generated environments to progressively improve the\\nskills that the agent is weak at, by providing feedback to the LLM in the form\\nof the agent's performance. We demonstrate the usefulness of EnvGen with\\ncomprehensive experiments in Crafter and Heist environments. We find that a\\nsmall RL agent trained with EnvGen can outperform SOTA methods, including a\\nGPT-4 agent, and learns long-horizon tasks significantly faster. We show\\nqualitatively how the LLM adapts training environments to help improve RL\\nagents' weaker skills over time. Additionally, EnvGen is substantially more\\nefficient as it only uses a small number of LLM calls (e.g., 4 in total),\\nwhereas LLM agents require thousands of LLM calls. Lastly, we present detailed\\nablation studies for our design choices.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-02-23\\nTitle: AgentLite: A Lightweight Library for Building and Advancing Task-Oriented LLM Agent System\\nAuthors: Zhiwei Liu, Weiran Yao, Jianguo Zhang, Liangwei Yang, Zuxin Liu, Juntao Tan, Prafulla K. Choubey, Tian Lan, Jason Wu, Huan Wang, Shelby Heinecke, Caiming Xiong, Silvio Savarese\\nSummary: The booming success of LLMs initiates rapid development in LLM agents. Though\\nthe foundation of an LLM agent is the generative model, it is critical to\\ndevise the optimal reasoning strategies and agent architectures. Accordingly,\\nLLM agent research advances from the simple chain-of-thought prompting to more\\ncomplex ReAct and Reflection reasoning strategy; agent architecture also\\nevolves from single agent generation to multi-agent conversation, as well as\\nmulti-LLM multi-agent group chat. However, with the existing intricate\\nframeworks and libraries, creating and evaluating new reasoning strategies and\\nagent architectures has become a complex challenge, which hinders research\\ninvestigation into LLM agents. Thus, we open-source a new AI agent library,\\nAgentLite, which simplifies this process by offering a lightweight,\\nuser-friendly platform for innovating LLM agent reasoning, architectures, and\\napplications with ease. AgentLite is a task-oriented framework designed to\\nenhance the ability of agents to break down tasks and facilitate the\\ndevelopment of multi-agent systems. Furthermore, we introduce multiple\\npractical applications developed with AgentLite to demonstrate its convenience\\nand flexibility.
